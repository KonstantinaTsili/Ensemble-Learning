# Airbnb_price_prediction

## Introduction

In the field of accommodation, traditional hotel accommodation still occupies a huge market share, whereas Airbnb is growing as one of the largest accommodation providers. The supply of the accommodation market is highly dynamic and influenced by various factors such as economic conditions, government policies, and external factors like natural disasters or pandemics. Additionally, the features of an apartment or a room such as an area, construction quality, location, and amenities can also significantly impact its price. As a result, it can be challenging for real estate players or property owners to estimate the accurate price of a hotel room on the Airbnb platform.

This project aims to develop a regression model using ensemble learning that can accurately predict the prices of accommodations on the Airbnb platform in New York City.
